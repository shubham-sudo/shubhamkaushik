Picking the right key-value store for a workload &mdash; and tuning it correctly &mdash; usually means running the same benchmark against a dozen candidate databases by hand. Existing benchmarks like **YCSB**, **db_bench**, and **KVBench** make this harder than it should be: each has its own setup process, its own configuration language, and none of them let you compare multiple databases against the *same* workload side by side.

**TexBench** is a unified key-value benchmarking suite that abstracts away workload configuration, benchmark setup, and database connections behind one interface. Point it at a workload and a set of databases, and it runs the benchmark against all of them and lets you compare the results directly.

<div class="caption">TexBench takes a workload &mdash; described in natural language or assembled from presets &mdash; and compiles it into a Tectonic specification that runs against multiple key-value stores side by side.</div>

Under the hood, TexBench builds on [**Tectonic**](/projects/tectonic/), a Rust-based, highly configurable key-value workload generator that can emulate multi-phased, dynamically shifting workloads &mdash; the kind of realistic access patterns that static benchmarks like YCSB can't capture.
