	\item \textbf{Range Query-Aware Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Trees} \textit{(Ongoing)}: Developing data reorganization strategies and layouts to optimize the performance of range queries in LSM-based storage systems.
	      \href{https://github.com/shubham-sudo/LSMQueryDrivenCompaction}{[\textcolor{blueviolet}{readme}]}
	      % LSM trees are at the heart of several NoSQL data stores due to their ingestion-optimized design. However, this superior ingestion 
	      % performance comes at the cost of poor range query performance and increased write amplification. In this project, we 
	      % introduce a new family of data reorganization strategies and data layouts, driven by range queries. These strategies allow us to (i) 
	      % reduce the overall data movement during workload execution and (ii) reduce the I/O cost for future range queries. I am
	      % currently in the process of integrating our solutions on RocksDB, a widely used commercial LSM-based data store.

	% \item \textbf{Enabling Efficient Range Deletes in LSM-Trees} \textit{(Ongoing)}: Introducing a lightweight and updatable range delete filter to avoid 
	      % superfluous accesses to storage using a small amount of metadata
	      % % LSM-based data stores perform 
	      % % data deletion logically, without physically deleting the target data objects. This leads to significant performance 
	      % % bottlenecks when deleting ranges of data, as the logically deleted data continues to `live' in the database, 
	      % % increasing the overall cost of operations. In this project, we introduce a light weight and updatable range delete filter to avoid 
	      % % superfluous accesses to slow storage in exchange for a small amount of metadata in memory. The proposed solution 
	      % % substantially reduces the execution cost for workloads with range deletes.

	\item \textbf{Multi Layered Detection Model (MLED) for Error Detection} \textit{(Ongoing)}: Creating a flexible system to reduce undetected errors in petabyte-scale file transfers through layered error-checking methods.
	      \href{https://github.com/shubham-sudo/mled}{[\textcolor{blueviolet}{readme}]}
				% MLED is a layered architecture designed to significantly reduce the Undetected Error Probability in file transfers. This is particularly 
	      % important for petabyte-scale file transfers, which are often used for data collected from scientific instruments. The 
	      % architecture is parameterized by a number of layers ($n$), and a policy ($P_i$) for each layer that describes its 
	      % operation. MLED provides flexibility with variable layer counts in different network sections and allows distinct 
	      % policies at various layers. Its recursive delivery system ensures a high probability of error-free file transfer to 
	      % the destination.

	\item \textbf{Heterogeneity-Aware Operator Placement for Streaming Systems}: Proposed a dynamic method to place data processing operators based on data selectivity, improving efficiency and reducing network traffic.
	      \href{https://github.com/shubham-sudo/HeterogeneityAwareOperatorPlacementforStreamProcessingSystemsAtEdge-RaspberryPi}{[\textcolor{blueviolet}{readme}]}
				% Streaming systems are widely used for real-time data processing. However, all operators within a cluster runs with a static configuration, which 
	      % is suboptimal for dynamic workloads. In this project, we proposed an approach to dynamically place operators based on 
	      % the selectivity and heterogeneity of the data. Toward this, I modified Apache Flink's scheduler to dynamically 
	      % switch tasks at the edge devices (\textit{Raspberry Pi}) and servers. This reduced the network traffic and improved 
	      % system efficiency and resource utilization.

	\item \textbf{Finding Vulnerabilities in VS Code Extensions}: Created a simulation framework to automate the installation and execution of VS Code extensions, identifying security vulnerabilities by analyzing open ports.
	      \href{https://github.com/prateekdceit06/VSCode-Extensions-Simulator}{[\textcolor{blueviolet}{readme}]}
	      % The use of third-party extensions can introduce 
	      % potential security vulnerabilities, which can also render the base applications vulnerable. In this project, I identified 
	      % security vulnerabilities in VS Code extensions and developed an automated tool for their detection. I devised a 
	      % simulation framework using the Pyautogui library to install and execute extensions, and detect security vulnerabilities 
	      % by analyzing the open ports associated with each extension. The analysis specifically targeted \textit{Path Traversal} and 
	      % \textit{Zip Slip} attacks, and detected 5\% of the extensions examined as vulnerable.
