  \item \textbf{Designing Range Query-Aware Log-Structured Merge (LSM) Trees} \textit{(Ongoing)}: LSM trees are at 
  the heart of several NoSQL data stores due to their ingestion-optimized design. However, this superior ingestion 
  performance comes at the cost of poor range query performance and increased write amplification. In this project, we 
  introduce a new family of data reorganization strategies and data layouts, driven by range queries. These strategies allow us to (i) 
  reduce the overall data movement during workload execution and (ii) reduce the I/O cost for future range queries. I am
  currently in the process of integrating our solutions on RocksDB, a widely used commercial LSM-based data store.

  \item \textbf{Anatomy of LSM Memory Buffer} \textit{(Ongoing)}: In LSM-based data stores, memory buffers are often overlooked 
  due to their small footprint, yet they serve as a critical gateway for data ingestion. This project focuses on optimizing 
  buffer implementations that dynamically adapt to shifting workloads to maximize performance. As a first step, we analyzed 
  existing buffer designs, with our findings accepted at DBTest 2024 (SIGMOD). Currently, we are exploring Cassandra’s trie-based 
  buffer and other novel implementations to expand the solution space, with the next milestone focused on workload-aware dynamic buffer switching policy.

  \item \textbf{Enabling Efficient Range Deletes in LSM-Trees} \textit{(Ongoing)}: LSM-based data stores perform 
  data deletion logically, without physically deleting the target data objects. This leads to significant performance 
  bottlenecks when deleting ranges of data, as the logically deleted data continues to `live' in the database, 
  increasing the overall cost of operations. In this project, we introduce a light weight and updatable range delete filter to avoid 
  superfluous accesses to slow storage in exchange for a small amount of metadata in memory. The proposed solution 
  substantially reduces the execution cost for workloads with range deletes.

  \item \textbf{Heterogeneity-Aware Operator Placement for Stream Processing Systems at the Edge}: Streaming systems process 
  real-time data but rely on static operator configurations, which are suboptimal for dynamic workloads. This project proposed 
  dynamic operator placement based on data selectivity and heterogeneity. I modified Apache Flink's scheduler to dynamically 
  switch tasks at the edge devices (\textit{Raspberry Pi}) and servers, reducing network traffic and improving system efficiency
   and resource utilization.

  \item \textbf{Finding Vulnerabilities in VS Code Extensions}: The third-party extensions can introduce security risks, 
  compromising base applications. I developed an automated tool to detect vulnerabilities in VS Code extensions. 
  I built a simulation framework to install, execute, and analyze extensions for open-port risks, specifically targeting 
  \textit{Path Traversal} and \textit{Zip Slip} attacks, identified vulnerabilities in 5\% of examined extensions.
