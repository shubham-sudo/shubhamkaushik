% My thesis analyzes the formal representation of object-oriented properties using colored Petri nets to enhance the 
% understanding of software fault behavior, offering insights for the software development, testing, and 
% maintenance phases. I modeled the various faults in object-oriented systems, emphasizing faults related to object 
% interactions, such as inheritance and polymorphism states.
